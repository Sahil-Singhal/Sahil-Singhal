## Hey there 🖐
I'm Sahil, an aspiring data scientist by day, a cricket and politics fanatic by night. 
When I'm not busy learning something new, you can find me defending my love for the most boring sport in the world (cricket) or debating the latest political controversy. 
In my free time, I like to invent new ways to procrastinate on my never-ending to-do list. 
Follow me on my journey to becoming a data science master (or at least pretending to be one on the internet).
